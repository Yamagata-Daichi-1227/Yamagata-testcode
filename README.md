- 👋 Hi, I’m @Yamagata-Daichi-1227
I'm a 24-year-old graduate student.
During my undergraduate years, I majored in the Department of Information and Communication Technology.
I'll leave a sample of my own code here.

- 👀I'm interested in infrastructure engineers, cloud engineers or application engineers.
- 🌱Currently, I am researching optical access networks at the university.

- 💞️Languages ​​I've used

  - python:
Currently, as a long-term intern at MICIN, Inc. (currently 10 months), I belong to the information security department and use it for network construction and in-house SE-related development. One that was created in python is one that automatically creates users for apps such as datadog and netscope using user tickets obtained from his open source project management software called redmine.

  - javascript:
This is also used as a long-term intern at MICIN, Inc. Strictly speaking, GAS is used, and the information of the saas application used in the company is managed collectively in a spreadsheet using webapi.

  - Server construction:
At MICIN, Inc., an approximate system is designed and operated using AWS. Therefore, we design and use the network including services in AWS (WAF settings, S3, EC2, etc.) and audit applications such as datadog and OpenSearch. In addition, although it is a network construction language, it also encodes and manages projects created using terraform.

  - Source code control:
Recently, I created a lambda to find unused users in AWS IAM, and created one to notify or delete slack using slack api. Also, since the above code management basically uses Github, I know the minimum Git code and how to use it.

  - other:
In university research, MATLAB is used to simulate the reduction of the average delay time of optical access networks.

  - Language learned in class:
C, C ++, Java
